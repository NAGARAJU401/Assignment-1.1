Java was introduced by James Gosling from Sun Microsystems in 1991.

1. Java is an object oriented language.

2.If we write program in any operating system we can rut it.

3.The byte code which is generated by the compiler is not native in any platform.

4.It any other operating system.The bytecode generated is a non-executable code and needs an interpreter to execute on a machine. 
This interpreter is the JVM and thus the Bytecode is executed by the JVM.

5.platform dependent executable generated by the JVM is excuted by the CPU.

6.The byte code which is generated by the compiler is not native in any platform.

7.Platform independent means we can write program once and executes any where.
